Daan,2020-02-22,1.0,2020,CA,regular hot coffee of different sizes is too insipid and tastes almost like hot water in several starbucks locations in southern california one of the possible causes for the insipidity of starbucks regular hot coffee is that store coffee brewers are not replenished with fresh coffee in a timely manner especially during store rush hours we made store associates aware of this issue at a few starbucks locations but havent seen any tangible improvement this is a quality control issue that warrants serious attention from starbucks top management,88

Mel,2019-04-30,1.0,2019,CA,when starbucks changed the rewards to stars they eliminated the unlimited free purchases now if you order more than one item you dont get the discount on multiple purchases as you did with the old rewards program and there was no notice of any kind advising that the unlimited free purchase had been either planned or discontinued matter of a fact when i complained to starbucks about this bait  switch all i got was a bunch of mumbo jumbo double speak legalese it appears that starbucks mo is now screw the customer they apparently havent learned anything from their last two publicity failures buyer beware use up your star rewards as fast as you can,115

Pat,2017-10-12,1.0,2017,VA,bought the milk frother at the official starbucks website had been a client for years paid twice as much as similar product on stores because i thought that a company like starbucks would check the quality and consequently back up their providers all to find out that the product is of a very poor quality used it for not more than  times paid   tax for a product that didnt last at all when calling starbucks customer service they need all sort of information to corroborate that it is actually one of their products ,93

Johnny,2017-09-28,1.0,2017,BC,the stores can make their own rules which contrast with corporate policies and the head office dont even care about it we even showed the store manager about the policies but theyre ignored we spent so much money to get to gold level and got my benefit waived because of their inconsistency i never got any phone call from their manager to explain why they did it such a big disappointment for a big company,75
Susan,2017-09-17,1.0,2017,NM,starbucks sends out an email indicating you are upgraded to a gold card woohoo they say they offer you a free drink or food item of your choice yet at the counter they deny it really these programs are only gimmicks to get you in the store and spend more money every stupid retailer or restaurant engages in this tactic a pizza place offers you a free personal pizza but the clerks push drinks and other crap on you you spend more than the free personal pan pizza stay away from these gimmicks im tossing the card out and a big reason why we have the health problems related to diabetes and obesity in this country is due to these designer coffee drinks do you really need a coffee with lots of high calories and sugar milk whipped cream and other garbage one drink has around  carbs you are better off eating a slice of pie save money and skip the designer coffee drinks skip the socalled rewards,168

shawn,2017-09-14,1.0,2017,OR,ive always loved starbucks because they were nice and clean i assumed buying items would come with reasonable return policy because the quality seemed high and the prices too my wife bought me a coffee grinder for christmas in  the blade came off this morning and i thought it would be easy to return i carried it all the way downtown and asked them if they had any warranty with things they sell they were rude accused me of stretching the dates and implied i was unreasonable to expect a grinder to work more than a few years even though the truth is i hardly ever used it they said they would give me the customer service phone no and i waited  minutes for that then i waited for  minutes minimum for a person my ear was sore from the cell phone i switched ears and talked to the rep who said all items are only returnable for  days with receipt,161

Christine,2017-09-09,1.0,2017,TX,when you get a good barista you get a good drink but those are hard to come by at starbucks now if you ask them to remake your drink some of them are okay with it but others have a lot of machismo or just way too much attitude the consistency of the drink tasting as it should from different locations is rare here in el paso if i would recommend anything i would recommend mesa street in the westside theres a girl there by the name of vanessa shes actually a great barista,94

Justin,2017-08-31,2.0,2017,CA,although the quality at starbucks is currently rewarding for me in the meantime however after witnessing disconcerting and unprofessional from one to two employees at the rancho san diego starbucks located next to petco during may  one employee who goes by the name miranda eventually her getting more complaints from customers along with me getting the orders wrong and accused me not once but twice for harassment in addition that she frames one employee for the issues while ultimately accusing with an employee going by the name ashley accusing me of scaring kids very poor quality ,96

Linda,2017-08-25,4.0,2017,TN,i have lived abroad  years and having a starbucks nearby was a touchstone to the us i have seen that starbucks provides more than coffee and muffins  at times it provides a safe haven to be left alone although i currently live in the us tennessee i regularly travel to other states i base my ratings upon observations of many starbucks locations in and out of the us,68
Susan,2017-08-25,3.0,2017,Other,their coffee is somewhat bitter and is very overpriced in addition i would like to see more glutenfree or at least wheatfree items on the menu the advantages customers can take their time enjoying their food and beverages if they choose to do so on premises and nobody hassles anyone to move along perhaps if starbucks paid their baristas decent wages employees wouldnt feel compelled to put out a tacky and obnoxious tip jar something customers have been seeing more and more of in places that dont offer table service did starbucks start this annoying trend or just encourage it,100
Dan,2017-08-24,1.0,2017,OR,the employees seem to have the same far left elitist attitude as the ceo and general direction of the company why anyone would spend  on coffee escapes me for that  i can get a pound of coffee beans store them in a vacuum container and grind fresh coffee every morning,50

Farah,2015-02-19,1.0,2015,NY,i dont know why but the service at starbucks on church street nyc was pretty bad  rude barrister i had ordered three different types of drink and was waiting for it i collected the first one after a while waiting it was not too busy as the barrister placed the other drink on the counter he did not say what order it was so i picked it up and asked if this was the mocha i ordered he said no its not your drink learn the difference he was very very rude about it so i said okay sorry about that then i heard him telling the other customer that making the drink is not hard at all but dealing with all of this is and of course he was referring to me he shouldnt have said that some of the employees have bad manners i guess they dont know what good customer service means individuals like that should not be working in that field,165
Slavi,2015-02-17,1.0,2015,IL,in the last couple weeks i start seeing my quad espresso getting half of the amount i usually was getting when i asked the coffee shop manager told me that starbucks is changing the amount of the water in a single espresso shot now for the same money im getting less espresso on top of it it is so bitter without the regular water amount it is hardly good for pleasure drinking i suspect they would like to get their lines moving faster but how about the great coffee experience at starbucks we all are lure to experience that is extremely unfair and unjust practice and since they are the only coffee shop in the near  miles around places i go you can imagine my disappointment and frustration with the half of the quad super bitter not healthy way of serving espresso at starbucks,144

Adrian,2009-10-03,1.0,2009,ER,i entered that specific store at w and  ave in manhattan and before queuing ive asked the manager if they were serving coffee press to share as it is advertised he said yes sir so i waited after charging me  instead of  he showed me the french press and ive said that it was too small for two he said oh no sir this is the press we normally use of course the press was too small  it was only for half a tall cup so he ordered the other guy to make another one but first theyve poured the coffee into a cardboard cup because they said that was the only press they had so the coffee was terrible mine was cold and tasted like petrol my partners was like a strong tea and to end it up i went to the restroom which is dirty smelly and worst of all  with no soap at all please if you like coffee and you like starbucks dont you ever go to the one in the w and  ave in manhattan never,181

Lisa,2009-08-13,1.0,2009,CA,i ordered a  grande latte this morning thursday  at the menlo park ca store on santa cruz ave approximately at  am the barista preparing the latte was extremely unprofessional unorganized and rude he called out each coffee without using the customers name which was very confusing to those of us waiting for our coffee when i asked him why he wouldnt call out each customers name to inform them that their coffee was ready he replied im tired of calling out peoples names and then proceeded to point to one of the cups on the counter and stated that one must be yours as i drove off and took a sip of my coffee i was disappointed as i received the wrong order lattes are not cheap i will no longer visit that starbucks management should speak to their employees as treating ones customers with respect is not too much to ask for and receiving the order you placed is also high on the list thank you for your time i do hope someone is actually reading these posts,179

Paula,2009-07-01,1.0,2009,CA,i have a starbucks grinder that is currently being recalled for a safety issue the replacement process is arduous and time consuming  weeks for a replacement to be received in the meantime the company expects its consumers to take their coffee to a store location for grinding when their website suggests grinding beans just before brewing what is the best way to store coffee how long will it stay fresh once roasted coffee begins to lose its flavor the longer it is exposed to air and moisture we recommend buying your coffee weekly storing it in an airtight container in a cool dark place and grinding it just before brewing coffee in an unopened flavorlock bag will stay fresh for several months you can learn more about how to brew great coffee in coffee education,135
Corey,2009-07-01,1.0,2009,AB,the inconsistency and inaccuracy of drinks i wish they would get orders right  out of  times my girlfriend visit they get the order wrong in edmonton last week i ordered a grande iced coffee with milk sweetened they forgot to add milk they added the milk after i mentioned the mistake theres too much ice in it but at least it was cold i had more luck with simpler drinks cafe americano or just a bold coffee my girlfriend usually orders a grande cafe vanilla light frapuccino she usually has to clarify or she will end up with vanilla bean the other blended crme based drink a few times they dont blend it long enough and it separates too fast one time they added whip cream to top hello it supposed to be light another favorite is the vanilla latte and they sometimes forget to add enough pumps of syrup or forget to add any pumps its frustrating from now on we check our drinks carefully before we leave if we complain they attempt to fix on the spot however other times we let it slide since it was too late,191
Jan,2009-06-14,1.0,2009,CA,i go to this starbucks ladera center uco on the way to work regularly and began to notice the service was going down depending on the cashier and server some days i get a polite greeting but most days theyre cold and impolite but since i really like americano i put up with most of their attitudes however for the past several times visiting their americano began to taste horrible first i thought it was just a bad day but every time i order it is consistently bad it tastes worse than their regular coffee i ended up throwing it away and vowed never to go back,107

Kimberly,2009-05-01,1.0,2009,TN,i asked for half caf coffee at approximately  pm they graciously tried to make me an americano and other things to accommodate me i realize that decaf is not something everyone uses however i like decaf and hate this new policy in the nashville area where i live they brew small amounts of decaf as requested i think this should be the policy all over the country something needs to be done for people like myself who need to limit the amount of caffeine that we use i am a regular customer probably  days a week at least please address this concern,102
Arpana,2009-04-29,1.0,2009,AB,i was going through the drive through ordering my regular venti chai tea misto w vanilla and when i got to the window i had to wait about  minutes before someone acknowledged me after that they handed me grande blueberry tea misto so i said it was a venti from there they transferred it into a venti cup and just added water i recognized the tea bags were a different color so i told them it was a chai tea misto she scoffed redid the order with a grande and of course then i asked is there vanilla in here she looked at me and then went back and literally transferred it into a venti again added vanilla and water,120
Diane,2009-04-20,1.0,2009,FL, in the morning i got the nasty barista i made the mistake of asking him to make sure the water was hot for the oatmeal this nasty young adult got such an attitude with me about how the water is always f and it is always hot the last  oatmeals i got from starbucks were lukewarm and there is never consistency with how much water they add i thought i would be a team player in these tough times and i have tried to patronize starbucks because i liked the idea that they provide employee health insurance after this incident and all i have read here and waiting for  minutes even when you try to alert them that you want decaf pikes peak is really turning me away from starbucks i can very easily go back to dunkin i am also shocked that you are supposed to get all three condiments that has never been offered to me,158
Patricia,2009-04-11,1.0,2009,GA,i was in the drive thru ordered  venti white mocha frapp with no whip cream double blended and  venti caramel mocha frapp with whip cream double blended she repeated it back that the caramel was a grande i said both were ventis she said go to the window no price or anything i went to the window and after a while a young man came with a venti i asked which one was this he said the one without cream and its  then he handed me the other and said this is a caramel and closed the window the girl came opened the window and almost threw my credit card at me and slammed the window ,116
Terri,2009-04-10,1.0,2009,IN,i have recently spoken with many starbucks customers and have come to the same conclusion and that is that starbucks has recently since  began making their coffee weaker i have had problems with starbucks recently and have been in contact with their customer service group concerning consistently receiving cold coffee from their stores and the inability to receive decaf coffee at certain times of the day to each they reply they are trying to cut costs during tough economic times apparently now a new way to cut cost is to make weaker coffee which cost their customers more money more money is needed because now it is necessary to pay for a shot of espresso to put in the coffee so it tastes like it did before the decision to make weaker coffee was made what used to be an unreasonable price for coffee is now made more unreasonable one must ask is starbucks losing their customers because of the tough economic times or are they losing their customer because they keep making decisions to weaken their once impeccable brand,180
J.King,2009-04-02,1.0,2009,NM,about one month ago i had an interview for work with starbucks of ruidoso nm the manager who interviewed me was robie  as robie described the dress code to me i realized she wasnt a great example of it her hair was highly teased glitter splattered on her face body and clothes blouse was very low cut and in the course of the interview began to cut down her employees she talked about getting rid of the bad apple she questioned me as to the fact that i needed to be ready at her beckoned call no matter what i was doing drop everything and come to work if she needed me that is if i were to be hired,120
