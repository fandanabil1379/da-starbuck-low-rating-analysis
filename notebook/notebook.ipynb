    "# <b>1 Introduction</b>\n",
    "Starbucks in the US received lots of reviews on CustomerAffair, but most of them are 1-star ratings. This worries the Customer Experience Manager because it affects customer satisfaction and how people see the brand. It's important to figure out why customers give low ratings so Starbucks can make things better, like improving service or product quality.\n",
    "The manager knows customer reviews are not just about the numbers. S/he needs to understand what customers are saying in their reviews, especially the 1-star ones. This will help them see what's wrong and provide immediate solutions. To address this issue, this analysis uses data from ratings and review content to find common issues and trends among US Starbucks customers\n",

You spend more than the free personal pan pizza. Stay away from these gimmicks. I'm tossing the card out.

This suggests that customers often express dissatisfaction related to aspects of their Starbucks experience, such as product quality ('coffee', 'drink'), service ('customer', 'store'), and ordering process ('order'). The repetition of these words indicates common themes of discontent among customers.\n",

    "- The frequent occurrence of n-grams like 'i went to starbucks', 'a cup of coffee', and 'i asked for a' suggests that customers are often describing specific incidents or interactions during their visits to Starbucks. These may include instances of receiving incorrect orders ('i asked for a'), encountering long wait times ('in front of me'), or dissatisfaction with the quality of products ('a cup of coffee').\n",
    "- The repetition of these n-grams implies that multiple customers have had similar negative experiences, leading to the use of common phrases in their reviews. The n-grams 'i have been a loyal' and 'i would like to' may also indicate attempts by customers to express their dissatisfaction or suggest improvements to their experiences."

    "<b>Summary</b>: In brief, this analysis seeks to investigate underlying factors contributing to the low ratings in American Starbucks. The analysis has shown that branches in California, the US, has the highest count of 1-rating score reviews. Typically, when customers write low rating reviews, they tend to use longer words to express their complaints. They often provide detailed description of their expreiences, frequenty mentioning words like 'went' and 'Starbucks'. Furthermore, the analysis has revealed that the main concerns revolve around product quality, service, and ordering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Recommendation</b>: Based on the findings, we recommend the following actions for the Customer Satisfaction Manager at Starbucks: prioritize specific regions, especially in California; focus on improving product quality; enhance customer service standards for stores in the state to address service-related complaints; and streamline the ordering process to reduce customer frustrations."
